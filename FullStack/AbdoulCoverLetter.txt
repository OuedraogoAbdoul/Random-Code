Dear Hiring Manager:

As you can see in my resume, I have a solid background in the technical filed. My qualifications include training and experience as a technician with skills to lead a team, troubleshoot and repair military equipment. I am member of the Oregon CERFP (First Responder) team and we are requiring to wear hazmat suite during training for decontamination. I am still a college student accustomed to a learning environment and can be trained quickly. What may not be adequately reflected in the resume is that fast-pace environment and pressures are no stranger to me; I function well under both.
My unique combination of education, training, and experience allows me to offer your firm great values as an employee. I look forward to meeting you to discuss the specific requirements for this position and my ability to meet them.  Please contact me at your convenience at the number or email above. Thank you for the time to consider me as an applicant for this position. 
Sincerely
